Setting up my S3 bucket and deploying Jekyll wasn't as easy as I thought it would be and I think I benefited a lot from the process. Especially becoming very familiar with DNS.

#### Goals :
1. Domains
2. Set up S3 buckets
3. Set up Jekyll for the buckets
4. Write a post and play around with Jekyll

#### DNS and Other:
Searching for the proper name to help describe what your site is about is a harder than I thought. I just wanted to use my name.
Nothing is quite as succinct as using your own name for your own url name. The best I could find at the was sjr-jr.
I think it works well, its quick and easy to remember.

I also transferred an older domain to Google Domains. Why Google? I wanted to keep all my information in my one place and
there is no place I visit more often that Google(maybe Reddit). Also I think Google's management is way easier that GoDaddy's.

Navigating GoDaddy's management page was a nightmare. Trying to unlock my website which was hidden at the bottom of a page.
Just trying to get into the transfer page for my one name was tough. I think I spent most of the night just trying to find it.
Once I did find it the process was a lot faster.

On the other hand Google's interface is great. It just makes sense. It is done a very Google way, but it works well for this.
For the time being Google will be the registrar.

#### Set up S3
This is the part I was looking most forward too. I've rented and management websites in the past but not full controlled them. I think this is a great opportunity for me to become familiar with AWS and learn more about Jekyll.

I could have used GitHub pages for hosting. I really wanted to the feeling of complete control for this.

I followed mostly [Amazon's guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/website-hosting-custom-domain-walkthrough.html)
I also followed [Daniel Whyte's](http://danielwhyte.com/app/design/2014/10/05/creating-a-jekyll-s3-server.html)

#### Jekylling Myself

While Jekyll is easy to get running it appears to have an endless amount of features.
From the FrontMatter to the CSS/SASS processing. There is much to learn.

#### Making a design

I'll be looking at other sites to get an idea because this white and black/stock layout while pretty isn't unique or
interesting. I do appreciate the built in responsive design though.   

I wanna set the site up to be like a typical scrolling blog without having to click on the post title to see the contents of the
post. Better yet would be a way to show enough to get someone's interest to click. That's probably what will be my first challenge.

#### Other Neat Stuff

[Jekyll Community Guide](https://jekyllrb.com/community/) is a pretty cool place to learn more about Jekyll.
