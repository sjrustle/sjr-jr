Hey, I'm Scott. I am web/mobile developer. I don't think there is a better way
to improve than by writing out my ideas. That's what you will find here.
You'll find me expressing my ideas and trying to be more
concise in what I want to say. It's also a place for reflection. It's like rubber
ducking to the world.
